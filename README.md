# Game Playing Agents


In this assignment you will be developing AI agents to play the game of Connect
Four based on the MCTS approach we have discussed in class. The game of Connect
Four is played on a grid with 7 columns and 6 rows, and the basic goal of each player
is to get four of their game pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Please
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four for more details on the rules and
gameplay. In the first part you will develop and test algorithms for making move
selections given a specific board state. In the second part you will test these
algorithms against each other in actual game play.
